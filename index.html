            <h2>Characteristics of Highly Successful People </h2>
            <p> o be successful, you have to use each day as an opportunity to improve, to be better, to get a little bit closer to your goals. It might sound like a lot of work—and with a busy schedule, next to impossible. But the best part is, the more you accomplish, the more you’ll want to do, the higher you’ll want to reach. So as long as you have the hunger for success, you will always have the power within you to achieve it.See an example: Imagine if you’re asking your parents or anyone else for guidance: What can I do in my life? They’re answering anything you want. And you don’t think you can do anything, you give up without trying to do it. This is your failure. Your imagination is the only limitation.
            Simply, we can say that nothing will stop you except your imagination, so if you have a lot of imagination, nothing will stop you, but if you don’t have any imagination, your strengths and abilities will be limited because you don’t have enough imagination to help you overcome your problems and difficulties.
            To achieve your goal, learn to use your imagination, and raise your thinking to a higher level. Your imagination is going to motivate you to move in the direction of your dreams.Don’t wait for the right time. The time will never be ‘ just correct.’ Start where you are and operate with whatever tools you have at your control, and you will find a better solution as you go along.
Change is a significant component of life. It’s a way of life.
So who’s responsible for the change?
No one but you!
It’s you who make the change in your lives, whether you like it or not, you may or may not be conscious of it. …We see more failure than success around us. Sometimes we are worried about it and trying to avoid it. But it is a fact that no one can achieve success without any failure.
I believe that you can’t achieve anything without hard work and sacrifice. Believe in your selves! Have faith in your skills! You can’t be successful or pleased without a modest but sensible faith in your powers.
“ If you are not willing to learn, No one can help you. If you are determined to learn, No one can stop you.” …</p><br><br>

        <h2>Your limitation—it’s only your imagination.</h2>
        <p>Our imagination is one of the keys to a productive life. In fact, life is only limited by a lack of imagination. Our imagination is the key to untold worlds when we grow up as children. And it has been shown that children with very active imaginations are more likely to dream as adults and strive for more things.
At the age of five, the children’s imagination is at their peak, their memory is sharp, and they can remember anything very quickly.
But it’s a sad fact that we’re told to “Stop Dreaming” and living in an imaginary world isn’t good for us. The worst thing you can do for yourself is to suppress your imagination, for it will only lay the foundation for accelerated aging, and all too often a life that feels unsatisfied.Everyone experience plenty of storms in their lives. Most of the storms catch you by surprise, so you have to learn very quickly that you couldn’t regulate the weather.
There’s nothing wrong with being incorrect, except by being scared of it we’re failing to learn. This knowledge and understanding makes us more experienced and skilled with every error.
Our lives depend on these mistakes. These mistakes teach us so we’re getting wiser. They tell us that we only need to pick ourselves up and continue when things go wrong.
Choosing to be positive and being fearless will determine how you will live your life. Every day we make decisions. Some decisions are easy and some are difficult or life-changing.
So go, be courageous, live, write. What else can you do?</p><br><br><hr>
